                                             The aim of the task is primarily to show a good 
                                             knowledge of OOP principles, a the use of architectural
                                             and design patterns is preferred. It is not essential that
                                             the program works. The task should be completed without additional
                                             questions.
                                             No need to write a database
                                             ● No need to write HTML / CSS code
                                             ● The emphasis is on OOP programming
                                             ● If possible, implement

                                             ○ Singleton pattern
                                             ○ Polymorphism
                                             ○ Exception handling
                                              The Fruit class describes a fruit tree, which is determined by its color and volume.
                                              An apple is a fruit that can be wormy.
                                              The juicer consists of two parts: fruit bowls and strainers.
                                              The fruit bowl has its own capacity and can contain fruit.
                                               The Fruit class describes a fruit tree, which is determined by its color and volume.
                                               The strainer is used for squeezing fruit. With each squeeze I can see how much juice is obtained.
                                               The juicer must not be overfilled, and it also does not accept wormy apples.
                                               By squeezing one fruit, the amount of juice equal to 50% of the volume is obtained fruit trees.
                                               Write a program that simulates the operation of a juicer with a volume of 20 liters.
                                               a. Actions are performed on the juicer, with each action logged in print to screen or save to a .txt file. 
                                               b. The juicer is programmed to perform 100 actions in a row. 
                                               c. Another apple is added every 9 squeezes. 
                                               d. The apple has a volume in the range of 1 to 5. 
                                               e. An apple has a 20% chance of being wormy.
                                               If the capacity of the juicer is exceeded, it is necessary to throw it away PremasenKapacitetException,
                                               and abort program execution.
